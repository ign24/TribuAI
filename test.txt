I love jazz music and indie rock, especially artists like Miles Davis and Arctic Monkeys. I'm passionate about impressionism art and modern sculpture. For fashion, I prefer minimalist sustainable brands. I value environmentalism and social justice. I love traveling to Paris, New York, and Berlin for their creative communities and music scenes. I'm drawn to creative communities and music lovers as my target audience.
